/**
  Songs

1. The spinning Songs   
    In the short time we have to play out our lives
    We get swept off our feet by the calm
    Remaining with the memories we'll always have
    Spinning them into two spirals and then they fade away
    
    As for me, I will sing the song of the present
    That's all I can do, be singing and talking
    I won't remember what happened at that time
    But it's been engraved in my heart, so let me go

2. See you again
